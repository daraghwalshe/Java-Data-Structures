# Java-Data-Structures
Java classes exploring Structures such as Linked-Lists etc

#### A third year college project :mortar_board: :three:

## PART A
> A program that reads in a Java source code file and checks to see if it has
> balanced {} brackets. The program should uses a stack, implemented as a linked list, to
> check the brackets.
> The program runs as a command line program and takes a filename as an
> argument and prints one of BALANCED or NOT BALANCED.
> For example:!
> C:> java checkBalanced “myProgram.java”!
> BALANCED! !

## Part B
> A program that simulates a token ring network. The implementation uses a circular
> list where users can be added (Logged On) and removed (Logged Off) from the network.
> The program is divided into two main sections.
> The first section adds a number of users to the Network. 
> The second section enters a loop that traverses the circular list and only ends when
> all users have logged off the network. 
> As the list is traversed each user is asked if they want to log off.
> The answer to this question is a random YES or NO. Eventually all user are logged off
> the network and the loop should ends.
> Your system outputs to screen each time a user logs on and when a user logs off.
